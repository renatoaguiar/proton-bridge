  # Messages imported to label only are added automatically to Archive folder.
  # Then it depends on the order: if the message is first imported to Sent
  # folder and later to that label with importing to Archive, message will not
  # be in Sent but Archive. The order is semi-random for the big messages,
  # e.g., it will do alphabetical order of mailboxes, but for under ten small
  #Â messages the order is random every time (because we are importing in
  # batches of up to ten messages and iterating through map we use to collect
  # messages is random). So we cannot for this test ensure the same output
  # every time.
